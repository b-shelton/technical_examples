# Unvsupervised Model Development
This repository contains an R script to develop an unsupervised clustering model.

The [unsupervised_model.R]() script is a fully reproducible example to develop and analyze a k-means clustering algorithm on HCPCS code Medicare billing data for a specific provider specialty type in the state of California. The data used is is the "Medicare_Provider_Util_Payment_PUF_CY2015.txt" and can be found at the following link: Â https://www.cms.gov/apps/ama/license.asp?file=http://download.cms.gov/Research-Statistics-Data-and-Systems/Statistics-Trends-and-Reports/Medicare-Provider-Charge-Data/Downloads/Medicare_Provider_Util_Payment_PUF_CY2015.zip

The goal of the script is to identify providers whose billing patterns differ drastically from their specialty peer group. The goal of the demonstration is to illustrate the following capabilities:
- Feature Generation
- Clustering
- Data Visualization
